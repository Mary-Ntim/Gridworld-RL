# EXPERIMENT WITH LEARNING POLICIES ON SIMPLE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS USING DIFFERENT METHODS

This repository contains **fully commented, reproducible code and a detailed report** for experiments on **Gridworld reinforcement learning using multiple methods** as part of advanced ML coursework.


## Project Description

This project involves **experiments with learning policies on simple reinforcement learning environments** using different methods on a **5x5 Gridworld environment** with special colored cells (blue, green, red, yellow) and well-defined stochastic transitions and rewards.

The experiments performed include:

✅ **Estimating value functions under an equiprobable random policy**:
- Using **explicit Bellman equations**
- Using **iterative policy evaluation**

✅ **Determining optimal policies** using:
- Explicit Bellman optimality equations
- Policy iteration
- Value iteration

✅ **Applying Monte Carlo methods**:
- With exploring starts
- With ε-soft policies
- Using off-policy learning with importance sampling
